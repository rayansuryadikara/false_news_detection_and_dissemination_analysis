• Misleading (Class): Tweets that relate to the topic and have accurate information according to the supporting URL but lead to wrong conclusions. 
• Other (Class): Tweets that do not relate to the topic or are not discussed in the supporting URL.

Each tweet is complemented by its topic and supporting URL. The topic is extracted from supporting URL and becomes a query to extract the tweets in the span of the first time the topic spreads on social media up to the seventh day. The supporting URLs are from Cek Fakta Tempo from Tempo and Turn Back Hoax from Mafindo.

Before examining the tweets, each annotator is advised to read the supporting URLs first to understand the trace of the facts. Supporting URLs are the only place for annotators to verify the tweet, so there is no need to manually look for other supporting evidence.
Each annotator checks whether the tweet is a statement or claim mentioned in the exposition of supporting URL. What needs to be checked is only claims or statements that are related to the topic, so if there is a tweet contains several other claims that are not related to the topic, then these claims does not need to be checked. 

Example:

The twenty-three EU ambassadors visited Prabowo-Sandi Campaign Team headquarters to discuss tax reform issues and openness for business and investment, social welfare issues and the polemic of permanent voter list issued by the Election Commissioner. Afterwards, the EU ambassadors also visited Jokowi-Ma'ruf Campaign Team headquarters to discuss the European Union's partnership with Indonesia. It is clearly stated that there was no discussion of support for candidate Prabowo-Sandi during the visit.
